"""A thin, readable wrapper over the ``/ufactory`` services of xarm_ros2.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The raw service API is fiddly in three specific ways, and every one of them
costs you an afternoon the first time:

1. **Angles are in radians.**  The UFACTORY SDK documentation is mostly written
   in degrees; the ROS 2 services are not.  Verified against the robot:
   ``/ufactory/get_servo_angle`` returns exactly what ``/ufactory/joint_states``
   publishes.

2. **A service call that "succeeds" tells you nothing.**  Every xarm service
   reports its own outcome in ``ret``.  ROS will happily hand you a response
   with ``ret=9`` and no exception.  This wrapper raises on any non-zero
   ``ret``, so a refused command is loud instead of silent.

3. **Mode and state gate everything.**  ``set_servo_angle`` needs mode 0
   (position control).  If MoveIt / ros2_control is running it holds the arm in
   mode 1 (servo streaming) and your commands are ignored.
   :meth:`Lite6Client.require_position_mode` checks for exactly that.

4. **set_state() and the reported state are different value spaces.**  You pass
   0 to set_state() to make the arm ready; it then *reports* state 2
   (sleeping/idle) or 1 (in motion).  A reported 0 never happens.  See the
   constants below.

Blocking by design
------------------
Every method here blocks until the robot answers, so you write your algorithm
top to bottom like a script.  That is the right shape for a lab exercise and it
keeps the control flow obvious.

It is also why you must **not** call these methods from inside a subscription
or timer callback: the call spins the node waiting for a response, but you are
already inside the spin, and the node deadlocks.  Call them from ``main()``.
If you need callbacks *and* service calls, that is a MultiThreadedExecutor with
a ReentrantCallbackGroup, and a different file.
